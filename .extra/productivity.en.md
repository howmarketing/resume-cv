 - Daily Productivity Kickstart Checklist

## Tasks:
- [ ] Wake up and head to the bathroom to splash water on your face, then dry off and go to the kitchen to drink a glass of cold water. Bring a water bottle back to your office to ensure regular hydration.
- [ ] Set a 1h30min timer to refill your water bottle.
- [ ] Start another 20min timer to stand up from your chair every 20 minutes, stretch your spine, perform two progressively higher jumps, and walk at least 20 steps before sitting down again.
- [ ] Schedule a 3 to 5-minute timer to begin focusing with guided meditation or binaural audio.
- [ ] Spend no more than 2 minutes visualizing the top three tasks of the day in your mind.
- [ ] Take up to 1 minute to decide which task should be tackled first.
- [ ] Visualize the steps to complete the first task as a series of comic strip frames in your mind.
- [ ] Start a 25-minute Pomodoro with an 8-minute break, during which up to 3 minutes can be allocated for a recursive self-analysis of your focus behavior.
- [ ] Recursive Self-Analysis of Focus Behavior: Conduct a self-review to assess if you:
  - [ ] Are working on the correct task;
  - [ ] Are satisfied with your productivity level;
  - [ ] Have experienced any focus deviations;
  - [ ] Have strategies to minimize focus deviations in the next Pomodoro.
- [ ] After completing a task, briefly engage in the Recursive Self-Analysis of Focus Behavior, preparing for a more in-depth review at the end of the Pomodoro.
